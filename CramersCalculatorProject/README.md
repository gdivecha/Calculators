# Cramer's Calculator (Java + JavaFX): <br/>

<strong>Description:</strong>  <br/>
This Cramer's Calculator uses the principles learned in the Linear Algebra course to find the values of the variables from a given set of equations. It does so by finding the determinant of the coefficients of the matrix first, then dividing the determinant of a new matrix (where the respective column of the desired coefficient is replaced with the values that the equations equal to) by the primary determinant.  <br/> <br/> 
<strong>Deployment:</strong><br/>When the program is run, the number of rows and columns must be determined and entered in the corresponding text boxes. Then, the values can easily be entered into the matrix shown.
