# GCD Calculator (C):
<strong>Description:</strong> <br/> This gcd calculator was developed using the concpets learned in Discrete Mathematics. Using the recursive Euclidean Algorithm taught in class, the code was developed to automate the process for demonstration purposes.  <br/> <br/>
<strong>Deployment:</strong> <br/> When the code is run, the numbers to find the gcd for can directly be hardcoded into the main function of the code
