# Gauss-Jordan Elimination Calculator (Java + JavaFX):
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91444858/166508940-ac2b0d07-181b-42f1-a077-a231ec1d84ee.png" width="300">
<strong>Description:</strong> This Gauss-Jordan Elimination Calculator uses the principles learned in the Linear Algebra course to find the values of the variables from a given set of equations. It does so by finding the determinant of the coefficients of the matrix first, then dividing the determinant of a new matrix (where the respective column of the desired coefficient is replaced with the values that the equations equal to) by the primary determinant.  
<br/><strong>Deployment:</strong> When the program is run, the number of rows and columns must be determined and intered in the corresponding text boxes. Thhen, the values can easily be entered into the matrix shown. 

# GCD Calculator (C):
<strong>Description:</strong> This gcd calculator was developed using the concpets learned in Discrete Mathematics. Using the recursive Euclidean Algorithm taught in class, the code was developed to automate the process for demonstration purposes. 
<br/><strong>Deployment:</strong> When the code is run, the numbers to find the gcd for can directly be hardcoded into the main function of the code
